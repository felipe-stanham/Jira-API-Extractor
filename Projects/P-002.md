## Design Decisions

### Approved Design Choices

1. **Multiple Sprints**: Create separate chart sets per sprint (Option A)
2. **Epic Sorting**: Sort by completion percentage, highest first (Option B)
3. **Zero Story Points**: Exclude from charts entirely (Option A)
4. **Chart Readability**: Show all epics, no limit (Option A)
5. **Epic Naming**: Truncate long names with ellipsis (Option D)
6. **Sprint Composition**: Show total story points per epic (Option A)
7. **Conditional Charts**: Epic Label charts only when `--epic_label` provided
8. **Data Source**: Use source data, maintain consistency with sheets (Option B)
9. **Stacked Bar Order**: Done → In Progress → To Do (left to right) (Option A)
10. **Missing Parent**: Group as "No Epic" or "Unassigned" (Option A)

## Technical Approach

### Data Flow
1. **Aggregate Data**: Use Scope 1 functions to group by epic, calculate story points by status category
2. **Extract Issues**: From Sprint/Epic Label/Open Epic source data (not Excel sheets)
3. **Generate Charts**: Create openpyxl chart objects with aggregated data
4. **Position Charts**: Layout charts in Progress sheet with proper spacing
5. **Export**: Include Progress sheet in final Excel workbook
6. **Verify Consistency**: Ensure chart data matches sheet data

### Key Considerations
- **Data Source**: Use source data (issues lists), not Excel sheets, to maintain consistency
- **Conditional Charts**: Epic Label charts only created when `--epic_label` provided
- **Multiple Sprints**: Create separate chart sets per sprint (3 charts per sprint)
- **Zero Story Points**: Exclude epics with 0 total story points from all charts
- **Epic Naming**: Truncate epic names to 40 chars + "..." for readability
- **Missing Parent**: Group issues without parent as "No Epic" or "Unassigned"
- **Sorting**: Sort epics by completion percentage (highest first) in all bar charts
- **Stacked Bar Order**: Done (left, green) → In Progress (middle, yellow) → To Do (right, blue)
- **Chart Limits**: Show all epics (no pagination), openpyxl can handle large charts
- **Color Consistency**: Reuse color scheme from existing charts

### Files to Modify
- `excel_exporter.py`: Add `_create_progress_sheet()` method
- `charts_helper_enhanced.py`: Add progress chart creation functions
- `main.py`: Ensure progress sheet creation in export flow
- `chart_colors.py`: Add progress state colors

---

## Success Criteria

✅ Progress sheet created with 7 charts (3 conditional)
✅ Charts accurately reflect story point progress
✅ Stacked bars show Done/In Progress/To Do breakdown
✅ Pie charts show sprint composition by epic
✅ Charts handle edge cases (no data, 0 points)
✅ Consistent styling with existing charts
✅ Documentation updated
✅ All tests passing

---

## Notes

### Chart Numbering
The specification has duplicate numbering (two "4" and two "5"). The actual 7 charts are:
1. Sprint Progress in Percentage (per sprint)
2. Sprint Progress in Story Points - Stacked (per sprint)
3. Sprint Composition - Pie (per sprint)
4. Epic Label Progress in Percentage (conditional)
5. Epic Label Progress in Story Points - Stacked (conditional)
6. Open Epic Progress in Percentage
7. Open Epic Progress in Story Points - Stacked

**Note**: For multiple sprints, charts 1-3 are created per sprint, resulting in 3N charts where N = number of sprints.

---

## Dependencies

- P-001 must be completed (provides story points, status category, parent key)
- Existing chart infrastructure (charts_helper_enhanced.py)
- openpyxl library for chart creation
- Story points data must be available and accurate

---

## Risk Assessment

**Low Risk:**
- Reusing existing chart infrastructure
- Data already available from P-001
- Similar to existing chart functionality

**Medium Risk:**
- Stacked bar charts may be complex in openpyxl
- Layout with 7 charts may require careful positioning
- Performance with large datasets (many epics)

**Mitigation:**
- Test stacked bar charts early
- Design flexible layout system
- Add pagination/filtering for large epic lists
- Implement efficient data aggregation

---

## Estimated Effort

- **Scope 1**: 3 days (data aggregation & helper functions - FOUNDATION)
- **Scope 2**: 1 week (3 sprint charts, multiple sprint handling)
- **Scope 3**: 2 days (2 epic label charts, conditional logic)
- **Scope 4**: 2 days (2 open epic charts, reuse logic)
- **Scope 5**: 2 days (styling, consistency across 7 chart types)
- **Scope 6**: 3 days (sheet creation, layout, positioning)
- **Scope 7**: 3 days (testing, documentation)

**Total**: ~3.5 weeks
