## Structure

Each project file should contain:

### 1. Project Overview
- Brief description
- Goals and objectives
- Success criteria

### 2. Scopes
Groups of related tasks that implement one feature or functionality.

Format:
```markdown
## Scope: [Scope Name]

### Tasks

- [ ] Pending task
- [ ] Another pending task
```

### 3. Next Steps
Clear list of immediate next actions to move the project forward.

### 4. Notes

## Task Status Markers
